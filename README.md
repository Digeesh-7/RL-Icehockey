# RL-Icehockey

I've been exploring the world of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and recently built an ice hockey game environment that automatically plays for 10 episodes. 🏒 Using RL, I trained an agent to play the game autonomously, and the results have been fascinating!

Here are some highlights from the project:

🤖 The agent uses trial-and-error to improve performance over each episode.

🎯 Key metrics such as rewards and actions per episode have shown a steady improvement.

🧠 It's been a great way to explore how RL can be applied to complex, real-time decision-making processes.
